# Library Management System

## Databse Project Overview
This project contains the **schema** for a Library Management System.  
The goal is to help a library maintain an **organized system** that makes it easy to:
- Track registered **members** and their activities.
- Manage **books** in stock and their status (Available, Borrowed, or Missing).
- Store details of **librarians** and their work shifts.
- Record **borrowing activities** (who borrowed what, when, and from which librarian).
